## NOTE

Currently broken. Apparently Trakt end-of-life'd v1 of their API (and I missed the memo). I'll fix it on a rainy day. 

## Info

Pick a random episode!

Upcoming features:

* cookies or something so episodes don't repeat?
* recognizing/learning when it's part of a multi episode set
* actual mobile support
* and more!
